Expo: Configuration with app.json
---

`app.json` is your go-to place for configuring parts of your app that don't belong in code. It is located at the root of your project next to your `package.json`. It looks something like this:

```javascript
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "My app",
    "slug": "my-app",
    "sdkVersion": "UNVERSIONED",
    "privacy": "public"
  }
}
```

`app.json` was previous referred to as `exp.json`, but for consistency with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) it has been consolidated under one file. If you are converting your app from using `exp.json` to `app.json`, all you need to do is add an `"expo"` key at the root of `app.json`, as the parent of all other keys.

Most configuration from `app.json` is accessible at runtime from your JavaScript code via [`Constants.manifest`](../../sdk/constants/#expoconstantsmanifest). Sensitive information such as secret keys are removed. See the `"extra"` key below for information about how to pass arbitrary configuration data to your app.

## ExpoKit

While some of the properties defined in `app.json` can be applied at runtime, others require modifying native build configuration files. For ExpoKit projects, we only apply these settings once, at the time the native projects are generated (i.e. when you run `expo eject`).

This means that for existing ExpoKit projects, **changing certain properties in `app.json` will not have the desired effect**. Instead, you must modify the corresponding native configuration files. In most cases, we've provided here a brief description of the files or settings that need to be changed, but you can also refer to the Apple and Android documentation for more information.

## Properties

The following is a list of properties that are available for you under the `"expo"` key in `app.json`:

### `"name"`

**Required**. The name of your app as it appears both within Expo and on your home screen as a standalone app.

> **ExpoKit**: To change the name of your app, edit the "Display Name" field in Xcode and the `app_name` string in `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`.

### `"description"`

A short description of what your app is and why it is great.

### `"slug"`

**Required**. The friendly url name for publishing. eg: `my-app-name` will refer to the `expo.io/@project-owner/my-app-name` project.

### `"owner"`

The primary user to use for publishing and creating builds. If not provided, defaults to the username of the current user.

### `"privacy"`

Either `public` or `unlisted`. If not provided, defaults to `unlisted`. In the future `private` will be supported. `unlisted` hides the experience from search results.
Valid values: `public`, `unlisted`

### `"sdkVersion"`

**Required**. The Expo sdkVersion to run the project on. This should line up with the version specified in your package.json.

### `"version"`

Your app version. On iOS, this corresponds to `CFBundleShortVersionString`, and the required format can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleshortversionstring).

> **ExpoKit**: To change your app version, edit the "Version" field in Xcode and the `versionName` string in `android/app/build.gradle`.

### `"platforms"`

Platforms that your project explicitly supports. If not specified, it defaults to `["ios", "android"]`.

### `"githubUrl"`

If you would like to share the source code of your app on Github, enter the URL for the repository here and it will be linked to from your Expo project page.

### `"orientation"`

Lock your app to a specific orientation with `portrait` or `landscape`. Defaults to no lock.
Valid values: 'default', 'portrait', 'landscape'

### `"primaryColor"`

On Android, this will determine the color of your app in the multitasker. Currently this is not used on iOS, but it may be used for other purposes in the future.

6 character long hex color string, eg: "#000000"

### `"icon"`

Local path or remote url to an image to use for your app's icon. We recommend that you use a 1024x1024 png file. This icon will appear on the home screen and within the Expo app.

> **ExpoKit**: To change your app's icon, edit or replace the files in `ios/<PROJECT-NAME>/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` (we recommend using Xcode), and `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-<RESOLUTION>`. Be sure to follow the guidelines for each platform ([iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/app-icon/), [Android 7.1 and below](https://material.io/design/iconography/#icon-treatments), and [Android 8+](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_adaptive)) and to provide your new icon in each existing size.

### `"appKey"`

By default, Expo looks for the application registered with the AppRegistry as `main`. If you would like to change this, you can specify the name in this property.

### `"androidShowExponentNotificationInShellApp"`

Adds a notification to your standalone app with refresh button and debug info.

### `"scheme"`

**Standalone Apps Only**. URL scheme to link into your app. For example, if we set this to `'demo'`, then demo:// URLs would open your app when tapped. String beginning with a **lowercase** letter followed by any combination of **lowercase** letters, digits, "+", "." or "-"

> **ExpoKit**: To change your app's scheme, replace all occurrences of the old scheme in `Info.plist`, `AndroidManifest.xml`, and `android/app/src/main/java/host/exp/exponent/generated/AppConstants.java`.

### `"entryPoint"`

The relative path to your main JavaScript file.

### `"extra"`

Any extra fields you want to pass to your experience. Values are accessible via `Constants.manifest.extra` ([read more](../../sdk/constants/#expoconstantsmanifest))

### `"rnCliPath"`

### `"packagerOpts"`

### `"ignoreNodeModulesValidation"`

### `"nodeModulesPath"`

### `"facebookAppId"`

Used for all Facebook libraries. Set up your Facebook App ID at https://developers.facebook.com.

> **ExpoKit**: To change this field, edit `Info.plist` and `AndroidManifest.xml`.

### `"facebookAutoInitEnabled"`

Whether the Facebook SDK should be initialized automatically. The default in Expo (Client and in standalone apps) is `false`.

> **ExpoKit**: To change this field, edit `Info.plist` and `AndroidManifest.xml`.

### `"facebookAutoLogAppEventsEnabled"`

Whether the Facebook SDK log app events automatically. If you don't set this property, Facebook's default will be used. (Applicable only to standalone apps.)

> Note that Facebook SDK must be initialized for app events to work. You may autoinitialize Facebook SDK by setting `facebookAutoInitEnabled` to `true`.

> **ExpoKit**: To change this field, edit `Info.plist` and `AndroidManifest.xml`.

### `"facebookAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled"`

Whether the Facebook SDK should collect advertiser ID properties, like the Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID, automatically. If you don't set this property, Facebook's default policy will be used. (Applicable only to standalone apps.)

> **ExpoKit**: To change this field, edit `Info.plist` and `AndroidManifest.xml`.

### `"facebookDisplayName"`

Used for native Facebook login.

> **ExpoKit**: To change this field, edit `Info.plist` and `AndroidManifest.xml`.

### `"facebookScheme"`

Used for Facebook native login. Starts with 'fb' and followed by a string of digits, like 'fb1234567890'. You can find your scheme at https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/ios in the 'Configuring Your info.plist' section.

> **ExpoKit**: To change this field, edit `Info.plist`.

### `"locales"`

Provide overrides by locale for System Dialog prompts like Permissions alerts

> **ExpoKit**: To add or change language and localization information in your iOS app, you need to use Xcode.

### `"assetBundlePatterns"`

      Configuration for setting custom intent filters in Android manifest.
      The following example demonstrates how to set up deep links. When
      the user taps a link matching *.myapp.io, they will be shown a
      dialog asking whether the link should be handled by your app or by
      the web browser.

      The data attribute may either be an object or an array of objects.
      The object may have the following keys to specify attributes of URLs matched by the filter:

      - scheme (string): the scheme of the URL, e.g. "https"
      - host (string): the host, e.g. "myapp.io"
      - port (string): the port, e.g. "3000"
      - path (string): an exact path for URLs that should be matched by the filter, e.g. "/records"
      - pathPattern (string): a regex for paths that should be matched by the filter, e.g. ".*"
      - pathPrefix (string): a prefix for paths that should be matched by the filter, e.g. "/records/" will match "/records/123"
      - mimeType (string): a mime type for URLs that should be matched by the filter

      See Android's documentation for more details on intent filter matching:

      developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters

      You may also use an intent filter to set your app as the default handler
      for links (without showing the user a dialog with options). To do so, you
      must set "autoVerify": true on the filter object below, and then
      configure your server to serve a JSON file verifying that you own the
      domain. See Android's documentation for details:

      developer.android.com/training/app-links

      To add or edit intent filters in an ExpoKit project, edit AndroidManifest.xml directly.
